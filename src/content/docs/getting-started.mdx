## Step 1: Set Up Cloud Credentials (If Needed)

**Note:** Cloud credentials are only required if you plan to use Route 53 as a source or target. 
If you're only using AXFR (zone transfer) for sources and targets, you can skip this step and proceed to creating zones.

**Coming Soon:** GCP Cloud DNS and Azure DNS support will be available in the near future.

If you need cloud credentials for Route 53, configure them:

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Credential**
3. Select **AWS Route 53** as your provider
4. Enter your AWS credentials:
   - **Access Key ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID
   - **Secret Access Key:** Your AWS Secret Access Key
5. Give your credential a descriptive name
6. Click **Create**

## Step 2: Create a Zone

Create a DNS zone that will be synchronized.

1. Navigate to **Zones** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Zone**
3. Enter your zone name (e.g., `example.com`)
4. Select a source type:
   - **Route 53:** Pull from AWS Route 53 (currently supported)
   - **AXFR:** Pull via zone transfer from a master DNS server (currently supported)
   - **GCP:** Pull from Google Cloud DNS (coming soon)
   - **Azure:** Pull from Azure DNS (coming soon)
5. Configure source settings (hosted zone ID, project ID, master IP, etc.)
6. Click **Create Zone**

## Step 3: Deploy a Hub

Deploy a hub container to sync your zones. Hubs run in your infrastructure and pull zones from sources, 
serve them via NSD, and push them to targets.

1. Navigate to the **Hubs** page from the main navigation, or open your zone detail page
2. Click **Create Hub**
3. Enter a hub label (e.g., `us-east-1-hub`)
4. Click **Create Hub**
5. Copy the Docker command and hub token that appear (token is only shown once!)
6. Run the Docker command on a server with Docker installed
7. The hub will automatically connect and start syncing zones
8. If created from the hubs page, attach the hub to zones from the zone detail page

### Example Docker Command

```bash
docker run -d \\
  --name dns-sync-hub-<your-hub-id> \\
  -e HUB_ID=your-hub-id \\
  -e HUB_TOKEN=your-hub-token \\
  -e CONTROL_PLANE_URL=https://your-saas.com \\
  -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \\
  ghcr.io/rogerb831/zonemesh/dns-hub:latest
```

## Step 4: Configure Targets

Configure where your zones should be pushed to after being synced.

1. On your zone detail page, scroll to the **Targets** section
2. Click **Add Target**
3. Select target type:
   - **Route 53:** Push to AWS Route 53 (currently supported) - requires Hosted Zone ID and region
   - **AXFR:** Configure as AXFR secondary (currently supported) - requires secondary server IP, port, and optional TSIG key
   - **GCP:** Push to Google Cloud DNS (coming soon)
   - **Azure:** Push to Azure DNS (coming soon)
4. Configure target settings based on the selected type
5. Select the appropriate credential
6. Click **Create Target**
