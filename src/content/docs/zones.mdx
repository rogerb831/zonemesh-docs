## Zone Sources

Zones can be pulled from various sources. Each source type requires different configuration.

### Route 53

Pull zones from AWS Route 53. Requires an AWS credential with Route 53 read permissions.

**Source Configuration:**

```json
{
  "hostedZoneId": "Z1234567890ABC",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

### GCP Cloud DNS (Coming Soon)

Pull zones from Google Cloud DNS. This feature will be available in the near future.

### Azure DNS (Coming Soon)

Pull zones from Azure DNS. This feature will be available in the near future.

### AXFR (Zone Transfer)

Pull zones via AXFR from a master DNS server. Supports TSIG authentication.

**Source Configuration:**

```json
{
  "masterIp": "192.0.2.1",
  "port": 53,
  "tsigKey": "base64-encoded-key",
  "tsigAlgorithm": "hmac-sha256"
}
```

## Zone Synchronization

Zones are automatically synchronized by hubs on a schedule (every 10 minutes by default). 
You can also trigger manual syncs and monitor sync status in real-time.

- **Automatic Sync:** Hubs check for zone updates every 10 minutes
- **Manual Sync:** Click **Sync Now** on a hub to trigger immediate synchronization
- **Config Refresh:** Click **Refresh Config** to fetch the latest zone configuration from the control plane
- **Status Monitoring:** View sync status and history in the zone detail page
- **Target Status:** See per-target sync status (fully synced, partial sync, error, etc.)
- **Push Retry Limit:** Configure how many times a hub should retry pushing to a target if it fails (default: 10, range: 0-50)

## Sync Status History

The zone detail page displays sync status history for the last 24 hours. This helps you track sync events and troubleshoot issues.

- **24-Hour Window:** Only sync events from the last 24 hours are displayed
- **Scrollable List:** Fixed-height scrollable table for easy navigation
- **Clear History:** Use the **Clear** button to remove all status history for a zone
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Status history older than 24 hours is automatically removed
- **Real-Time Updates:** Status updates appear in real-time as syncs complete
- **Per-Hub History:** View sync history for each hub attached to the zone

## Editing and Deleting Zones

You can edit zone source configuration or delete zones from the zones list or zone detail page.

- **Edit Zone:** Click the edit icon on a zone to update its source type and configuration
- **Delete Zone:** Use the delete action to permanently remove a zone and all its targets
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple zones and delete them at once from the zones list page
- **Note:** Deleting a zone will also delete all associated targets, but hubs remain available for other zones
