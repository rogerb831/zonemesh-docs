## Zone Sources

Zones can be pulled from various sources. Each source type requires different configuration.

### Route 53

Pull zones from AWS Route 53. Requires an AWS credential with Route 53 read permissions. Note that Route 53 doesn't support AXFR/IXFR natively—learn more about [why Route 53 zone transfers are hard](https://zonemesh.io/blog/why-route-53-zone-transfers-are-hard) and how ZoneMesh enables zone transfers with Route 53.

To add a Route 53 zone source:

1. Click **Create Zone** from the Zones page
2. Enter the zone name (e.g., `example.com`)
3. Select **Route 53** as the source type
4. Select the AWS credential to use (must have Route 53 read permissions)
5. Enter the **Hosted Zone ID** from your AWS console (e.g., `Z1234567890ABC`)
6. Select the **Region** closest to your hub location
7. Click **Create** to save the zone

<Callout type="tip">
Route 53 is a global service, but API calls require a region. Use the region closest to your hub location for best performance.

### GCP Cloud DNS (Coming Soon)

### AXFR (Zone Transfer)

Pull zones via AXFR from a master DNS server (BIND, NSD, PowerDNS, etc.). Supports TSIG (Transaction Signature) authentication for secure zone transfers.

To add an AXFR zone source:

1. Click **Create Zone** from the Zones page
2. Enter the zone name (e.g., `example.com`)
3. Select **AXFR** as the source type
4. Enter the **Master IP** address of your DNS server
5. Optionally configure TSIG authentication (see below)
6. Click **Create** to save the zone

<Callout type="warning">
Ensure your master DNS server allows zone transfers from your hub's IP address.
</Callout>

#### Configuring TSIG Authentication

TSIG (Transaction Signature) provides cryptographic authentication for DNS zone transfers, preventing unauthorized access to your zone data. When enabled, ZoneMesh authenticates to your master DNS server using a shared secret.

To enable TSIG when creating or editing an AXFR zone:

1. Toggle **Enable TSIG Authentication** to on
2. Enter the **Key Name** — a unique identifier that must match exactly on your master DNS server (e.g., `transfer-key`)
3. Enter the **Secret** — a base64-encoded shared secret (at least 32 bytes recommended)
4. Select the **Algorithm** — choose from `hmac-sha256` (recommended), `hmac-sha512`, `hmac-sha1`, or `hmac-md5`

<Callout type="info">
The TSIG key name, secret, and algorithm must match exactly between ZoneMesh and your master DNS server. Consult your DNS server's documentation for configuring TSIG keys.

## Zone Synchronization

Zones are automatically synchronized by hubs on a schedule (every 10 minutes by default). 
You can also trigger manual syncs and monitor sync status in real-time.

- **Automatic Sync:** Hubs check for zone updates every 10 minutes
- **Manual Sync:** Click **Sync Now** on a hub to trigger immediate synchronization
- **Config Refresh:** Click **Refresh Config** to fetch the latest zone configuration from the control plane
- **Status Monitoring:** View sync status and history in the zone detail page
- **Target Status:** See per-target sync status (fully synced, partial sync, error, etc.)
- **Push Retry Limit:** Configure how many times a hub should retry pushing to a target if it fails (default: 10, range: 0-50)

<Callout type="info" title="Sync Frequency">
Zones sync automatically every 10 minutes. For faster updates, you can trigger manual syncs at any time from the hub or zone detail page.
</Callout>

## Sync Status History

The zone detail page displays sync status history for the last 24 hours. This helps you track sync events and troubleshoot issues.

- **24-Hour Window:** Only sync events from the last 24 hours are displayed
- **Scrollable List:** Fixed-height scrollable table for easy navigation
- **Clear History:** Use the **Clear** button to remove all status history for a zone
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Status history older than 24 hours is automatically removed
- **Real-Time Updates:** Status updates appear in real-time as syncs complete
- **Per-Hub History:** View sync history for each hub attached to the zone

## Editing and Deleting Zones

You can edit zone source configuration or delete zones from the zones list or zone detail page.

- **Edit Zone:** Click the edit icon on a zone to update its source type and configuration
- **Delete Zone:** Use the delete action to permanently remove a zone and all its targets
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple zones and delete them at once from the zones list page

<Callout type="warning" title="Deleting Zones">
Deleting a zone will also delete all associated targets. However, hubs remain available and can be attached to other zones.
