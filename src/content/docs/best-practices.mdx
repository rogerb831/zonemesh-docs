## Security

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Best Practices">
Follow these recommendations to keep your DNS infrastructure secure:
</Callout>

- Use IAM roles/service accounts with minimal required permissions (read-only for sources, write for targets)
- Rotate credentials regularly for better security
- Use TSIG keys for AXFR transfers when possible to secure zone transfers
- Restrict hub container network access to necessary endpoints only
- Keep hub containers updated using the "Update Software" feature
- Never share hub tokens or credentials
- Use proper SSL certificates in production (never disable SSL verification)

<Callout type="danger" title="Never Share Credentials">
Hub tokens and cloud provider credentials should never be shared or committed to version control. Treat them as sensitive secrets.
</Callout>

## High Availability

<Callout type="tip" title="Redundancy is Key">
For production deployments, always plan for redundancy:
</Callout>

- Deploy multiple hubs in different regions/availability zones
- Attach zones to multiple hubs for redundancy
- Configure Docker restart policies: `--restart unless-stopped`
- Monitor hub status regularly

<CodeBlock filename="docker-restart-policy.sh">
{`docker run -d \\
  --restart unless-stopped \\
  --name dns-sync-hub-<your-hub-id> \\
  -e HUB_ID=your-hub-id \\
  -e HUB_TOKEN=your-hub-token \\
  -e CONTROL_PLANE_URL=https://your-saas.com \\
  -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \\
  ghcr.io/rogerb831/zonemesh/dns-hub:latest`}
</CodeBlock>

## Performance

<Callout type="info" title="Optimize Sync Performance">
These tips will help you achieve optimal synchronization performance:
</Callout>

- Place hubs close to your DNS sources for faster sync times
- Use multiple hubs in different regions to distribute load and improve redundancy
- Monitor sync times in the status history and adjust if needed
- Configure appropriate push retry limits based on your network reliability
- Attach zones to multiple hubs for redundancy and faster synchronization

<Callout type="tip">
Sync status history shows the last 24 hours of sync events. Use this to identify patterns and optimize your setup.
</Callout>
