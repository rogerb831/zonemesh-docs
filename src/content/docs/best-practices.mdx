## Security

- Use IAM roles/service accounts with minimal required permissions (read-only for sources, write for targets)
- Rotate credentials regularly for better security
- Use TSIG keys for AXFR transfers when possible to secure zone transfers
- Restrict hub container network access to necessary endpoints only
- Keep hub containers updated using the "Update Software" feature
- Never share hub tokens or credentials
- Use proper SSL certificates in production (never disable SSL verification)

## High Availability

- Deploy multiple hubs in different regions/availability zones
- Attach zones to multiple hubs for redundancy
- Configure Docker restart policies: `--restart unless-stopped`
- Monitor hub status regularly

## Performance

- Place hubs close to your DNS sources for faster sync times
- Use multiple hubs in different regions to distribute load and improve redundancy
- Monitor sync times in the status history and adjust if needed
- Configure appropriate push retry limits based on your network reliability
- Attach zones to multiple hubs for redundancy and faster synchronization
