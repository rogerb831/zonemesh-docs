## General Guidelines

- Most resources can be edited by clicking the edit icon (pencil) next to the resource
- Delete actions are available in dropdown menus or action buttons
- Bulk operations (delete multiple items) are available on list pages by selecting items with checkboxes
- Some resources cannot be deleted if they are in use (e.g., credentials used by zones/targets, hubs attached to zones)

## Zones

- **Edit:** Update zone name, source type, and source configuration
- **Delete:** Permanently removes the zone and all its targets (hubs remain available)
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple zones from the zones list page and delete them at once

## Hubs

- **Edit:** Hub labels can be updated (though this is typically not necessary)
- **Delete:** Only available if the hub is not attached to any zones
- **Detach:** Remove hub from zones without deleting the hub itself
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple hubs from the hubs list page and delete them at once

## Targets

- **Edit:** Update target type, configuration, and credentials
- **Delete:** Remove target from a zone
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple targets from the targets list page and delete them at once

## Credentials

- **Edit:** Update credential name and configuration (e.g., access keys, service account JSON)
- **Delete:** Only available if the credential is not used by any zones or targets
- **Note:** Before deleting a credential, ensure no zones or targets are using it
