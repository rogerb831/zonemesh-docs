## When Are Credentials Needed?

Cloud provider credentials are only required when using Route 53 as a source or target. 
If you're using AXFR (zone transfer) for both sources and targets, you don't need to configure any cloud credentials.

- **Route 53 source/target:** Requires AWS credentials (currently supported)
- **AXFR source/target:** No cloud credentials needed (uses zone transfer protocol, currently supported)
- **GCP Cloud DNS source/target:** Coming soon - will require GCP service account credentials
- **Azure DNS source/target:** Coming soon - will require Azure service principal credentials

## Credential Security

All credentials are encrypted at rest and are never stored in plain text. Credentials are only decrypted 
when needed by hubs for DNS operations, ensuring your cloud provider credentials remain secure.

## AWS Route 53 Credentials

To use Route 53 as a source or target, you need AWS Access Keys. Follow these steps to create and configure them.

### Step 1: Create AWS IAM User and Access Keys

1. Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Navigate to **IAM** → **Users** → **Create User**
3. Enter a username (e.g., `dns-sync-route53`)
4. Click **Next** to set permissions
5. Attach policies with Route 53 permissions:
   - `AmazonRoute53ReadOnlyAccess` (for pulling zones as a source)
   - `AmazonRoute53FullAccess` (for pushing zones as a target)
   - Or create a custom policy with only the permissions you need (see below)
6. Click **Next** and then **Create User**
7. Open the user → **Security credentials** tab
8. Click **Create access key**
9. Select **Application running outside AWS**
10. Click **Next** and then **Create access key**
11. **Important:** Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** immediately - the secret is only shown once!

### Step 2: Add Credentials to the Application

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar (or go to `/dashboard/integrations`)
2. Click **Add Credential**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Credential Name:** A descriptive name (e.g., "Production Route 53")
   - **Provider:** Select "AWS Route 53"
   - **Access Key ID:** Your AWS Access Key ID
   - **Secret Access Key:** Your AWS Secret Access Key
   - **Region:** AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
4. Click **Create Credential**

**Note:** Route 53 is a global service, but API calls require a region. Use `us-east-1` as the default.

### Required AWS Permissions

For Route 53 operations, the IAM user needs the following permissions:

**Custom IAM Policy (JSON):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:ListHostedZones",
        "route53:GetHostedZone",
        "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
        "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
        "route53:GetChange"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or use the managed AWS policies:

- `AmazonRoute53ReadOnlyAccess` - For read-only operations (pulling zones)
- `AmazonRoute53FullAccess` - For read/write operations (pulling and pushing zones)

### Using Credentials

Once created, credentials are available when:

- Creating a zone with Route 53 as the source
- Adding a Route 53 target to push zones to

**Tip:** You can create multiple credential sets (e.g., one for development, one for production) and select the appropriate one for each zone or target.

## GCP Credentials (Coming Soon)

GCP Cloud DNS support will be available in the near future. When available, you'll need to create a service account 
in your GCP project with the appropriate DNS roles.

## Azure Credentials (Coming Soon)

Azure DNS support will be available in the near future. When available, you'll need to create an Azure AD application 
(service principal) with the appropriate DNS zone permissions.

## Editing and Deleting Credentials

You can edit credential configuration or delete credentials from the integrations page.

- **Edit Credential:** Click the edit icon on a credential to update its configuration
- **Delete Credential:** Use the delete action to remove a credential (only if not in use by any zones or targets)
- **Note:** You cannot delete credentials that are currently being used by zones or targets. 
  Update or remove those zones/targets first.
