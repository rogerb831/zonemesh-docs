## What is a Hub?

A hub is a Docker container that runs in your infrastructure. It:

- Pulls DNS zones from configured sources
- Serves zones via NSD (authoritative DNS server)
- Pushes zones to configured targets
- Reports sync status to the control plane
- Supports AXFR/IXFR zone transfers

## Hub Requirements

- **Docker:** Docker or Docker Compose installed
- **Network:** Outbound HTTPS access to the control plane
- **Ports:** Port 53 TCP/UDP (for DNS queries and AXFR transfers)
- **Resources:** Minimal - 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core

## Hub Status

Hubs report their status in real-time. Status indicators:

<div className="space-y-2 my-4">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Badge className="!bg-green-500 text-white hover:!bg-green-600 border-transparent">online</Badge>
    <span>Hub is connected and syncing</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Badge variant="secondary">offline</Badge>
    <span>Hub is not connected</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Badge variant="destructive">error</Badge>
    <span>Hub encountered sync errors</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Badge variant="outline">provisioning</Badge>
    <span>Hub is initializing</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Hub Management Page

Access the dedicated hubs management page from the navigation menu to view and manage all your hubs in one place.

- **View All Hubs:** See all hubs across all zones with their status and attached zones
- **Create Hub:** Create new hubs without attaching to a zone first
- **Hub Actions:** Sync, refresh config, restart, test services, or delete hubs
- **Zone Links:** Click on zone names to navigate to zone detail pages

## Hub Management Actions

- **Sync Now:** Trigger immediate zone synchronization for all zones attached to the hub
- **Refresh Config:** Fetch latest zone configuration from control plane
- **Restart Hub:** Send restart command to hub container (reloads DNS server configuration)
- **Services Test:** Test hub services to verify DNS server and DNS resolution are working correctly
- **Detach:** Remove hub from a zone (hub container continues running and can be attached to other zones)
- **Delete Hub:** Permanently delete a hub (only available if the hub is not attached to any zones)
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple hubs and delete them at once from the hubs list page
- **Update Software:** Update hub container software to the latest version (bulk update available)

## Services Test

The Services Test feature allows you to verify that your hub is functioning correctly by testing two key services:

- **DNS Server Test:** Verifies that the hub's DNS server is running and responding
- **DNS Resolution Test:** Verifies that the hub can resolve DNS queries correctly

To run a services test, navigate to a hub detail page or use the "Test Services" button in the hub actions menu. 
Test results will appear showing whether each service passed or failed, along with any error messages.

## Hub Detail Page

Each hub has a dedicated detail page where you can view and manage all zones attached to the hub, 
monitor hub status, and view sync history.

- **Attached Zones:** View all zones currently attached to the hub
- **Attach Zone:** Add zones to the hub from the hub detail page
- **Detach Zone:** Remove zones from the hub
- **Status History:** View sync history for all zones on this hub (last 24 hours)
- **Hub Information:** View hub ID, status, last seen time, and creation date
