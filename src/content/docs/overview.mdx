ZoneMesh is a DNS synchronization platform that enables you to keep DNS zones synchronized across multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure. 
You deploy hub containers in your own infrastructure that pull zones from sources and push them to targets, giving you full control over your DNS data.

<Callout type="info" title="Full Control">
ZoneMesh gives you complete control over your DNS data. Hubs run in your infrastructure, ensuring your DNS zones never leave your network until you explicitly push them to targets.
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **Multi-provider DNS synchronization** - Route 53, AXFR (GCP Cloud DNS and Azure DNS coming soon)
- **Real-time status monitoring** - Track sync history and hub health in real-time
- **Secure credential management** - All credentials encrypted at rest
- **Automated zone synchronization** - Hubs sync zones automatically on a schedule
- **Hub health testing** - Built-in diagnostics to verify hub functionality
- **Bulk operations** - Manage multiple resources efficiently
- **Flexible plans** - Free and Pro subscription options

<Callout type="tip" title="Coming Soon">
GCP Cloud DNS and Azure DNS support will be available in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!

## How It Works

ZoneMesh follows a simple workflow to keep your DNS zones synchronized:

1. **Configure Credentials** - Set up cloud provider credentials in the Integrations page (only needed for Route 53)
2. **Create Zones** - Define DNS zones and specify where to pull DNS records from (sources)
3. **Deploy Hubs** - Deploy hub containers in your infrastructure to handle synchronization
4. **Attach Zones** - Connect zones to hubs for synchronization
5. **Configure Targets** - Specify where to push DNS records to (targets)
6. **Automatic Sync** - Hubs automatically sync zones on a schedule and push changes to targets

<Callout type="info">
Hubs sync zones every 10 minutes by default. You can also trigger manual syncs at any time.
