description: What is ZoneMesh?

ZoneMesh is a DNS synchronization platform that enables you to keep DNS zones synchronized across multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure. 
You deploy hub containers in your own infrastructure that pull zones from sources and push them to targets, giving you full control over your DNS data.

## Key Features

- Multi-provider DNS synchronization (Route 53, AXFR - GCP Cloud DNS and Azure DNS coming soon)
- Real-time status monitoring and sync history
- Secure credential management with encryption
- Automated zone synchronization
- Hub health testing and diagnostics
- Bulk operations for managing multiple resources
- Flexible subscription plans (Free and Pro)

## How It Works

1. Configure cloud provider credentials in the Integrations page
2. Create DNS zones and specify where to pull DNS records from (sources)
3. Deploy hub containers in your infrastructure
4. Attach zones to hubs
5. Configure targets (where to push DNS records to)
6. Hubs automatically sync zones on a schedule and push changes to targets
