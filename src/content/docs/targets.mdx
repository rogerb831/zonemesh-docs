## Target Types

Zones can be pushed to various DNS providers. Each target type requires different configuration.

### Route 53 Target

Push zones to AWS Route 53. Requires an AWS credential with Route 53 write permissions.

**Target Configuration:**

```json
{
  "hostedZoneId": "Z1234567890ABC",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

### GCP Cloud DNS Target (Coming Soon)

Push zones to Google Cloud DNS. This feature will be available in the near future.

### Azure DNS Target (Coming Soon)

Push zones to Azure DNS. This feature will be available in the near future.

### AXFR Secondary Server

Configure NSD to allow zone transfers to secondary DNS servers. The secondary servers will pull 
zones via AXFR/IXFR from the hub's NSD server.

**Target Configuration:**

```json
{
  "ip": "192.0.2.1",
  "port": 53,
  "tsigKey": "base64-encoded-key",
  "tsigAlgorithm": "hmac-sha256"
}
```

**Note:** AXFR targets don't require pushing - the hub's DNS server is configured to 
allow zone transfers to the specified IP addresses. Secondary servers pull zones automatically.

## Editing and Deleting Targets

You can edit target configuration or delete targets from the zone detail page or the targets list page.

- **Edit Target:** Click the edit icon on a target to update its configuration and credentials
- **Delete Target:** Use the delete action to remove a target from a zone
- **Bulk Delete:** Select multiple targets and delete them at once from the targets list page
- **Target Status:** View real-time sync status for each target (fully synced, partial sync, error, etc.)
