## Hub Connection Issues

### Hub shows as "offline"

- Check if the Docker container is running on your server
- Check container logs for error messages
- Verify the hub ID and token are correct in your Docker command
- Ensure the control plane URL is accessible from your hub's network
- Check firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS connections
- Use the "Services Test" feature to diagnose hub issues

### Hub connects but immediately disconnects

- Verify the hub token is correct and hasn't been regenerated
- Check network connectivity to the control plane
- Review hub container logs for authentication errors
- Ensure the hub token matches the one shown when you created the hub

### SSL certificate verification error

If you see SSL certificate errors in your hub logs:

- This typically occurs in development/test environments with self-signed certificates
- Add `-e SSL_VERIFY=false` to your Docker run command
- **Never disable SSL verification in production** - always use proper SSL certificates

## Zone Sync Failures

### Zone sync fails with credential error

- Verify credentials are correctly configured in Integrations
- Check credential permissions match requirements
- For AWS Route 53: Verify IAM user has Route 53 permissions
- For AXFR: Verify master DNS server allows zone transfers from your hub's IP address

### Zone sync fails with "zone not found"

- Verify zone name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check source configuration (hosted zone ID, project ID, etc.)
- Ensure the zone exists in the source DNS provider

### AXFR transfer fails

- Verify master DNS server IP address is correct
- Check if TSIG key is required and correctly configured
- Ensure port 53 TCP is accessible from the hub
- Verify the master DNS server allows zone transfers from your hub's IP address
- Check hub logs for specific AXFR error messages

## Target Push Failures

### Target push fails

- Verify target configuration (hosted zone ID, project ID, etc.)
- Check credential has write permissions
- Ensure target zone exists in the DNS provider
- Review hub logs for detailed error messages

### AXFR secondary cannot pull zone

- Verify AXFR target is configured in the zone
- Use the "Services Test" feature to verify the hub's DNS server is running
- Verify port 53 TCP/UDP is accessible from the secondary server
- Check that the hub's IP address is allowed to transfer zones to the secondary
- Review hub logs for zone transfer attempts and errors

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

- Check hub container logs for detailed error messages
- Review sync status history in the zone detail page (shows last 24 hours)
- Use the "Services Test" feature to verify hub functionality
- Check target status indicators to see which targets are failing
- Verify credentials have the correct permissions for your DNS providers
- Contact support with hub logs, zone configuration, and error details
